My latest CV is available for download as [HTML][cv-html] or [PDF][cv-pdf].

What, no Microsoft Word version!?!? Nope, sorry - it's authored in markdown
and published to PDF/HTML only at the moment.

If you're interested, Ruby scripts and templates for generating the CV
are available on [github](https://github.com/jwoffindin/markdown-resume-ruby).
The latest version of my CV is on this [branch](https://github.com/jwoffindin/markdown-resume-ruby/tree/john_woffindin).
